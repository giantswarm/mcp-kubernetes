# Kubernetes API permissions that could bypass user RBAC.
#

  #   - "standard": Read + limited write (includes CLUSTER-WIDE SECRET ACCESS)
  #   - "admin":    Full access (requires explicit confirmation)
  #
  # NOTE: When enableDownstreamOAuth is true, this setting is IGNORED and
  # "minimal" is enforced automatically for security.
  #
  # For Service Account Mode (enableDownstreamOAuth: false):

    # Trusted Scheme Registration for Cursor/VSCode Compatibility
    # This feature allows unauthenticated client registration for clients using
    # specific custom URI schemes (e.g., cursor://, vscode://), while requiring
    # registration tokens for all other clients.
    #
    # Security Model:
    # Custom URI schemes can only be intercepted by the application that registered
    # the scheme with the OS. An attacker cannot register a malicious OAuth client
    # with cursor:// because they cannot receive the authorization callback.
    #
    # IMPORTANT: This security model has platform-specific limitations:
    # - On macOS, multiple apps can register for the same scheme (OS prompts user)
    # - On some platforms, scheme registration is first-come-first-served
    # - Malware with elevated privileges could potentially hijack scheme handlers
    #
    # Recommendation: This feature is most appropriate for:
    # - Internal/corporate deployments where client machines are managed
    # - Development environments
    # - Scenarios where the convenience outweighs the platform-specific risks
    #
    # For high-security production deployments exposed to the internet, consider
    # using registration tokens instead (--registration-token).
    #
    # Schemes must conform to RFC 3986: start with a letter, followed by letters,
    # digits, plus (+), hyphen (-), or period (.). Dangerous schemes (javascript,
    # data, file, ftp) are blocked.

    # library implements comprehensive SSRF protection (blocks private IPs, DNS rebinding).
    #

    # Trusted Audiences for SSO Token Forwarding
    # When users connect through upstream aggregators (like muster), they may have
    # already authenticated. This setting allows mcp-kubernetes to accept tokens
    # issued to those trusted upstream services, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO).
    #
    # How it works (mcp-oauth v0.2.39):
    #   - When a trusted audience is detected, the token is validated via JWT/JWKS
    #   - The IdP's JWKS endpoint is fetched to verify the token signature
    #   - User info is extracted directly from JWT claims (no userinfo call needed)
    #   - This fixes the bug where userinfo calls failed for forwarded ID tokens
    #
    # Security Model:
    #   - Tokens MUST still be from the configured issuer (Google/Dex)
    #   - Tokens MUST be cryptographically signed by the issuer
    #   - Only explicitly listed client IDs are trusted
    #   - Audit events are logged when accepting cross-client tokens

  # RBAC configuration for CAPI mode
  #
  # IMPORTANT: CAPI RBAC is ALWAYS created when capiMode.enabled is true.
  # This is required for CAPI mode to function correctly.
  #
  # SECURITY MODEL:
  # The ServiceAccount needs access to retrieve cluster credentials, regardless
  # of whether OAuth Downstream is enabled. The type of access depends on the
  # workloadClusterAuth.mode setting:
  #
  #   - "impersonation" mode: ServiceAccount reads kubeconfig Secrets
  #   - "sso-passthrough" mode: ServiceAccount reads CA ConfigMaps (no secrets)
  #
  # When enableDownstreamOAuth is TRUE (recommended for production):
  #   - Users authenticate via OAuth (Dex, Google, etc.)
  #   - Users can discover clusters they have RBAC to list
  #   - ServiceAccount reads kubeconfig secrets/CA configmaps
  #   - This prevents users from bypassing impersonation via kubectl
  #   - All workload cluster operations enforce user impersonation
  #
  # When enableDownstreamOAuth is FALSE (legacy mode):
  #   - ServiceAccount is used for all Kubernetes API operations
  #   - Users share the ServiceAccount's RBAC permissions
  #
  rbac:
    # Create CAPI-specific RBAC resources
    # When enabled, creates:
    #   - ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding for CAPI cluster discovery
    #   - Namespace-scoped Roles/RoleBindings for secret/configmap access
    #     (based on allowedNamespaces and workloadClusterAuth.mode)
    #
    # This setting is subordinate to the top-level rbac.create:
    #   - rbac.create: false → no RBAC at all (master switch)
    #   - rbac.create: true + capiMode.rbac.create: false → only base profile RBAC
    #   - rbac.create: true + capiMode.rbac.create: true → base + CAPI mode RBAC
    #
    # Set to false when you manage CAPI RBAC externally or want to use
    # your own ClusterRoles for CAPI resource access.
    create: true
    # Namespaces to grant kubeconfig secret / CA configmap access
    # REQUIRED: You must list namespaces where your CAPI clusters are defined
    # Giant Swarm convention: org-* namespaces (e.g., org-giantswarm)
    # Use [] only if clusterWideSecrets is true (not recommended)
    allowedNamespaces: []
    # When allowedNamespaces is empty and clusterWideSecrets is true,
    # grants cluster-wide secret access (use with caution)
    # NOTE: In sso-passthrough mode, this grants ConfigMap access instead
    clusterWideSecrets: false

  # Workload cluster authentication configuration
  #
  # This controls how mcp-kubernetes authenticates to workload clusters.
  # Choose ONE mode per deployment - there is NO automatic fallback between modes.
  #
  # 1. "impersonation" (default):
  #    - Uses admin credentials from kubeconfig secrets
  #    - Applies user impersonation headers to all WC API requests
  #    - Requires ServiceAccount to have kubeconfig secret read access
  #    - WC RBAC enforced via impersonation headers
  #
  # 2. "sso-passthrough":
  #    - Forwards user's SSO/OAuth ID token directly to WC API servers
  #    - Only requires CA certificate and cluster endpoint (NO admin credentials)
  #    - ServiceAccount does NOT need access to kubeconfig secrets
  #    - WC API servers must be configured with OIDC authentication
  #    - Same Identity Provider must be trusted by all clusters
  #    - User's own RBAC permissions apply (no impersonation)
  #    - Better audit trail (shows direct OIDC auth)
  #    - SECURITY: If SSO token is rejected by WC, the request FAILS
  #      (no fallback to impersonation - this is by design)
  #
  # See docs/sso-passthrough-wc.md for detailed configuration and requirements.
  workloadClusterAuth:
    # Authentication mode: "impersonation" or "sso-passthrough"
    mode: "impersonation"
    # ConfigMap suffix for CA certificates (used in sso-passthrough mode)
    # The full ConfigMap name is: ${CLUSTER_NAME}${caConfigMapSuffix}
    # These ConfigMaps should be created by an operator that extracts the CA certificate
    # (tls.crt) from the CAPI-generated ${CLUSTER_NAME}-ca secret.
    # The CA certificate is public information and stored in a ConfigMap, not a Secret.
    caConfigMapSuffix: "-ca-public"
    # Disable client caching in sso-passthrough mode (high-security option)
    #
    # When enabled, each request creates a fresh client with the current SSO token.
    # This is recommended for high-security deployments to ensure:
    #   - Tokens are never cached beyond their natural lifetime
    #   - Token revocation takes effect immediately
    #   - No risk of reusing expired tokens from cache
    #
    # Trade-off: Higher latency per request (no connection reuse).
    # Default: false (caching enabled for better performance)
    disableCaching: false

  # Privileged secret access configuration (split-credential model)
  #
  # SECURITY MODEL:
  # When OAuth downstream is enabled, the ServiceAccount reads kubeconfig secrets
  # on behalf of users. This prevents users from bypassing impersonation by
  # extracting admin credentials directly via kubectl.
  #
  # NOTE: When using workloadClusterAuth.mode: "sso-passthrough", this configuration
  # applies to CA-only secret access instead of full kubeconfig secret access.
  #
  # See docs/rbac-security.md for detailed security model explanation.
  privilegedSecretAccess:
    # Strict mode: When enabled, fails instead of falling back to user credentials
    # when ServiceAccount access is unavailable.
    #
    # SECURITY RECOMMENDATION:
    # Enable this in production to enforce the split-credential security model.
    # When disabled (default), the system falls back to user credentials,
    # which may require users to have secret read permissions (weaker security).
    #
    # Default: false (fallback enabled for backward compatibility)
    strict: false

    # Rate limiting for privileged secret access
    # Prevents abuse by limiting requests per user
    rateLimit:
      # Rate limit per user (requests per second)
      # Default: 10.0
      perSecond: 10.0
      # Burst size per user
      # Default: 20
      burst: 20

# Grafana Dashboard provisioning
# Enables pre-built Grafana dashboards for mcp-kubernetes observability.
# Dashboards are provisioned as ConfigMaps that can be picked up by

# Prerequisites:
#   1. Prometheus must be scraping mcp-kubernetes metrics (ServiceMonitor or manual config)
#   2. Grafana sidecar must watch for ConfigMaps with 'grafana_dashboard: "1"' label
#   3. A Prometheus datasource must be configured in Grafana
#
