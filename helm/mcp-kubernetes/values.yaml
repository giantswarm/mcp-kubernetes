    # Trusted Scheme Registration for Cursor/VSCode Compatibility
    # This feature allows unauthenticated client registration for clients using
    # specific custom URI schemes (e.g., cursor://, vscode://), while requiring
    # registration tokens for all other clients.
    #
    # Security Model:
    # Custom URI schemes can only be intercepted by the application that registered
    # the scheme with the OS. An attacker cannot register a malicious OAuth client
    # with cursor:// because they cannot receive the authorization callback.
    #
    # IMPORTANT: This security model has platform-specific limitations:
    # - On macOS, multiple apps can register for the same scheme (OS prompts user)
    # - On some platforms, scheme registration is first-come-first-served
    # - Malware with elevated privileges could potentially hijack scheme handlers
    #
    # Recommendation: This feature is most appropriate for:
    # - Internal/corporate deployments where client machines are managed
    # - Development environments
    # - Scenarios where the convenience outweighs the platform-specific risks
    #
    # For high-security production deployments exposed to the internet, consider
    # using registration tokens instead (--registration-token).
    #
    # Schemes must conform to RFC 3986: start with a letter, followed by letters,
    # digits, plus (+), hyphen (-), or period (.). Dangerous schemes (javascript,
    # data, file, ftp) are blocked.

    # Disable strict scheme matching for trusted scheme registration

    # Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) - MCP 2025-11-25

    #
    # Security: CIMD requires the server to make outbound HTTPS requests. The mcp-oauth
    # library implements comprehensive SSRF protection (blocks private IPs, DNS rebinding).
    #
    # Network Policy: When OAuth is enabled, egress to "world" is already allowed in

    # Trusted Audiences for SSO Token Forwarding
    # When users connect through upstream aggregators (like muster), they may have
    # already authenticated. This setting allows mcp-kubernetes to accept tokens
    # issued to those trusted upstream services, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO).
    #
    # How it works:
    # 1. User authenticates with muster (gets token with audience "muster-client")
    # 2. Muster forwards the user's ID token to mcp-kubernetes
    # 3. mcp-kubernetes accepts the token because "muster-client" is in trustedAudiences
    #
    # Security considerations:
    # - Only explicitly listed client IDs are trusted (no implicit trust)
    # - Tokens must still be from the configured issuer (Dex/Google)
    # - The IdP's cryptographic signature proves token authenticity
    # - Audit events are logged when accepting cross-client tokens
    #
    # Example: ["muster-client", "my-aggregator-client"]
    # Default: [] (no trusted audiences, SSO disabled)
    trustedAudiences: []

      # This also allows loopback (127.0.0.0/8, ::1) and link-local addresses.
      #
      # When trustedAudiences is configured, mcp-kubernetes validates forwarded ID
      # tokens by fetching the IdP's JWKS to verify signatures. If your IdP (like Dex)
      # is deployed on a private network, JWKS fetching may fail without this option.
      #
