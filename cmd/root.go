	Long: `mcp-kubernetes is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides
tools for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It offers various capabilities
including resource management, pod operations, context switching, and cluster
information.

When run without subcommands, it starts the MCP server (equivalent to 'mcp-kubernetes serve').`,

	// Example of how to define persistent flags (global for the application):
	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.config/mcp-kubernetes/config.yaml)")

	// Example of how to define local flags (only run when this action is called directly):
	// rootCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
