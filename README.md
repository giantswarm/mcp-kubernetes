# MCP Kubernetes

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides comprehensive Kubernetes management capabilities through structured tools and interfaces.

## Overview

This project implements an MCP server for Kubernetes operations, providing a standardized interface for AI agents and tools to interact with Kubernetes clusters. It supports multi-cluster operations, non-destructive mode, and comprehensive resource management.
